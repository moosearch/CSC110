		In these 2 hours you will be introduced to the software and equipment in the lab and the support staff. Lab sessions are &#39;must attend&#39; concentrating on exercises that are designed to instruct good programming and debugging techniques. Each week the lab exercises help you build the skills that assist you not only to complete the current assignment, but also to be for successful in the course.</p>

	<h4>
		A tour of your computer&#39;s directory...</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Where are the programs you will use and where you will be saving your files. Every time you log into a CSc lab machine a permanent directory is mounted from a server. This appears to you as a local disk space designated the H: drive. Files stored to your H: drive will be available to you no matter where you log in in ECS. Files left on your desktop or on someplace else on the C: drive are often scrubbed and will not be there the following day.</li>
		<li>
			An efficient way to work, is to work in a folder on the desktop and drag the good copies to your H: drive periodically and certainly before you leave. That&#39;s like having your own archive. It is also a good idea to organize your code into sub-folders, so it does not pile up in one enormous &#39;labs&#39; folder.</li>
		<br />
		<li>
			Submitting assignments in Connex (Demo).
			<ul>
				<li>
					We log a temporary account into Connex</li>
				<li>
					We select the Assignments tool on the left</li>
				<li>
					Below the link to the assignment there is an add attachments button. Select that.</li>
				<li>
					Browse for the files you would like to submit adding each as an attachments.</li>
				<li>
					When that is done hit continue.&nbsp; Forgetting to continue until confirmation is the most common reason for files thought to be submitted but not actually there.</li>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		Type in:</p>
	<p>
		<img alt="exercise 1" height="100" src="images/Ex1.jpg" width="344" /></p>
	<p>
		It is necessary to save this fragment in a plain text file named Ex01.java (The file name must match the class name exactly including case, and the file extension must be .java.&nbsp; Note that the third character in the name is a zero.). While it is not necessary, we recommend that you save it on the H: Drive, in a folder labelled CSC110, in a sub folder labelled lab_1. You will find that this extra level of organization will serve you well.&nbsp; Do not embed spaces in filenames (makes navigating with command prompt a pain).</p>
	<p>
		To compile the java &#39;source code&#39; which we just saved, open up a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where Ex01.java was saved. You can get a command line view of it by typing <strong>dir</strong> when you navigate there.</p>
	<table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" width="100%">
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p class="style11">
						To avoid having to navigate in the Command Prompt window each time you make a new folder, you can: make a copy of the Command Prompt shortcut and paste it in the same directory/folder where you put your program. Right click on your Command Prompt copy and select properties. Locate the <b>Starts In</b> box and remove the path in that box. Apply your changes and close the Command Prompt shortcut. When you open up this copy of the Command Prompt shortcut it opens where ever it is placed. Very convenient, very fast.</p>
					<p class="style11">
						Another way that can get you a command prompt window in your current directory is to hold the Shift key and right click in your directory. There should be an option in the menu to open a command prompt window in that directory. Even faster.</p>

					<p class="style11">
						If there are any errors, fix them and recompile, ensuring there are no more errors. Examine the directory where you have stored Ex01.java. There should be a new file named Ex01.class.

	<strong><em>Ex 3 More Printing and some expressions:</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Your TA will show you a few additional lines to put in your program, printing frequently so that you can see the effect of your code.&nbsp; Good ideas are arithmetic expressions, repeated operations on the same variable to show you how a variable can be updated using itself as part of the expression.&nbsp; a = a +1 ... print ... a = a*a ... print and so on.&nbsp; We should have a look at the mod operator (%) too.</p>
	<p>
		Something to continue with is some ASCII art, to practice escape characters. Anything except the dog from assignment one is fine.</p>

		Test the FunWithNumbers program shell by compiling and running. Whenever you are given code you should see if it: a) compiles and b) runs. Sometimes if you drag on code in a browser window you will pick up invisible characters which will defeat the compiler. You should always save the linked file to your desktop rather than dragging code from a browser window.</p>

		Debugging</p>
	<p>
		The links below have code with bugs; error(s) have been introduced. Visually trace each to see if you can first spot the error. Later you can compile to see what the compiler indicates. If the compiler has no complaints determine if there is a runtime error or a logical error.</p>

<h3>
	<b><font size="5">Important Notes</font></b></h3>
<blockquote>
	In the beginning of this course, you should practice typing in your program shells without looking at reference material until you can type a program shell from memory. Later you can apply that same technique to method stubs and eventually to rudimentary classes.This term our mantra will be:&nbsp; We do not code that which we do not understand.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	Writing code or typing code is coding.&nbsp; To demonstrate our understanding to someone else we must first be able to describe our proposed solution in words, picture, glyps, circles and arrows or some combination of all of these, before we code.&nbsp; For debugging a TA will not look at code until given a description of the problem and a desired outcome.&nbsp; TA&#39;s will not listen while the student is looking at a screen.<br />
