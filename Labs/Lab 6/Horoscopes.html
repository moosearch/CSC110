October 12, 2010 Aquarius: Remembering the little things like trimming your fingernails and watering the plants will keep your hands hygienic and your plants alive, but it won't help you pass your midterms. Pisces: Take a well-deserved break, and regret it for the rest of your life! Aries: You want to make a change, but nothing too drastic. Washable markers to the face will be a unique but temporary way to shake up your look. Taurus: You're doomed! You're all doomed! Gemini: For you, Gemini, life is all about opposite extremes, so don't get too excited when I say that something really good will happen to you in the coming weeks. Cancer: You need to pay more attention to Chris. If you're thinking "Chris who?", that's exactly what I'm talking about. Leo: Expect some minor inconveniences in the near future, like a paper-cut, the hiccoughs or criminal detainment under false pretenses. Virgo: Blame all of your problems on the bunnies. It works for UVic; it'll work for you. Libra: Your balance has been lost this week. Good things will come in ones and bad things in fives. Scorpio: The sun will soon be in your constellation, giving you the energy to achieve your goals, but don't get too cocky: the sun gives energy to every land-dwelling creature, every day. Sagittarius: You have three days left to live. If you are reading this later in the week, you may already be dead. Capricorn: Let's stop kidding ourselves; everyone knows that Capricorns can't read. October 25th, 2010 Aquarius: You have a lot of catching up to do, karma-wise. Hold the door, plant a tree and high-five as many orphans as you can find. You don't have a lot of time. Pisces: You will accidentally trip someone who will stalk you on a quest to trip you back. Maybe consider being less of a clumsy jerk? Aries: You are attending Alex's wedding tomorrow. If this doesn't ring true, it's time to talk to your parent(s)/guardian(s) about why they've been lying to you about your birth date. Taurus: Stubborn and broad-shouldered Taurus. You should find all the nearby Capricorns and give them back massages. You'll get stronger and they'll get better massages. Win-win. Gemini: There is an important decision coming up for you, and hundreds of inconsequential ones. Cancer: A computer will upset you this week. Try not to take it out on the machine, because it will have been your fault. Leo: You are the bravest sign - but also the most pathetic: having to get your confidence from silly, badly researched horoscopes. Virgo: You enjoy a challenge, so you must really be living the dream. (You'll be happy to know it doesn't get easier.) Libra: If you can't take the heat, find your true calling as a hotel elevator operator. One day, Libra. You cannot escape destiny! Scorpio: Some relationship advice: relationships take time and you have none (time nor relationships). So, things just got a lot simpler. Sagittarius: You are struggling to cope with a lot of guilt. If not, you should be, you callous monster! Capricorn: A life-changing moment will occur in the coming week, but you will be too busy to notice. November 15, 2010 Aquarius: The next week will see the return of an old friend, Loneliness. Pisces: You will be struck out of nowhere by a DeLorean doing nearly 90mph. You'd better have a promising future ahead or they may not bother going back to undo it. Aries: Are you still here? Taurus: More like 'bore-us!' Guffaw! Gemini: A man in his early forties, wearing brown corduroy jeans will ask you for directions tomorrow afternoon between 2:30 and 3:30. That man is your real father. Cancer: Your grandpa Fred is not pleased with your progress to date. What do you mean you don't have a grandpa Fred? Leo: You haven't accomplished as much as you'd wanted lately. You need to stop setting your sights so high and accept that you're just a lazy bum. Virgo: That attractive student you've had your eye on? Yeah, well so have I - back off! Libra: Something is going to happen, sometime. Sometime soon. Somewhere. Somewhere soon. Scorpio: Carry an extra pencil with you and know your multiplication tables. These things may come in handy in the days to come because the sun is entering your constellation and such. Sagittarius: You're going to develop a horrible, deadly cheese allergy. Eat as much as you can before it sets in! But not after. Capricorn: One of your professors thinks you have great potential. Wait, that's not a professor, it's crazy, homeless Joe. He's so crazy. November 29, 2010 Aquarius: When you tell yourself that you just need to try harder, well, you need to try significantly harder than *that.* Pisces: You will find some money on the street. It won't be a lot of money, but you'd better pick it up. Trust me. Aries: I didn't want to have to tell you... but you're a jerk, destined for failure. I guess I didn't have to tell you that; I just wanted to. So much for that first part. Taurus: Remember to put out milk and cookies for the spirits. They get mighty cranky and vengeful when they don't get their cookies. Gemini: Stop brushing your teeth. It'll be funny. If you already weren't brushing your teeth, now is the time to begin! Cancer: Go ahead and do a genuinely good deed for another person and find out, as it goes ignored, why more people aren't nicer more often. Leo: Try eating badly and doing less. What's the worse that could happen? Virgo: Make more use of the free phones on campus, even if you have no one to call. Your lucky numbers for this week are the odd ones. Libra: One Libra claimed to speak for everyone when he traded blissful immortality for a second beer. That is why no one likes you. Scorpio: I see a cloudy, blustery future for you in the coming weeks, with a high probability of rain. Sagittarius: Music will cheer you up! It won't make you better looking or more successful though. Capricorn: Beware of rickety old bridges over spiky depths. May 24, 2011 Aquarius: You may be offended by an opinion today, but that is because you're a dumb-ass. Pisces: Your constellation is retrograde in the egg planet. It is a good week for omelettes. Aries: You will be kidnapped by mole people. There's nothing you can do to avoid this inevitability. You're doomed. Doomed! Taurus: You will find inspiration at the bottom of a bottle of hot sauce. It's going to burn, but it's totally worth it, probably. Gemini: You need a better hiding place for those pictures. Cancer: A trusted friend will stab you in the back - unless you stab them first. Leo: You've been doubting yourself lately, but you shouldn't. Or should you? Virgo: When Jimmy invites you to a midnight party at the abandoned mill built on the ancient native burial ground, just say no. Libra: Those friends that tell you they don't like you and to stop calling them: Buddy, those aren't your friends, guy! Scorpio: Feeling murderous? Seek help - or murder! Sagittarius: If you've been washing your hands in bleach and they're swollen and red: Stop! For serious? Capricorn: Now is a good time to stab your trusted friend in the back. June 2, 2011 Aquarius: Your Scorpio friends have put a curse on you. If they deny it, it's probably pretty bad. Pisces: Eating more vegetables will make you feel better. What? It's true! But you aren't going to do it, are you? Aries: You have been replaced by an identical copy of your former self, by mole people. Taurus: The dream you had last night has come true. The part that you couldn't remember. Gemini: Make some new friends so you can neglect them as midterms, endless assignments and crunch time approach. I hear it's better than never having friends at all. Cancer: You are better-looking than you think. But you were right about how badly you did on that assignment. Leo: You've been wondering to yourself 'Why? Dear God, why? Why am I doing this?' Let me know if you come up with a good answer. Virgo: Mercury, guardian of travellers and your ruling planet, makes this week your luckiest for playing in traffic. Libra: Allergies have been getting you down - or rather, people with allergies. Scorpio: Looking directly into the sun today will give you superpowers, like not being able to see. Sagittarius: When you're drawing a blank, use made-up filler words like spambleizeetaseridoo. Capricorn: Spambleizeetaseridoo copyright P. and F. Gordon 2010
